# Host and Network Penetration Testing - CTF 2 (eJPT / INE)

## Objective
This lab focuses on post-exploitation host and network enumeration, lateral movement, privilege escalation, and capturing flags in an internal network environment.

---

## Initial Access
- Enumerated SMB shares using `smbclient` and `enum4linux`.
- Found valid credentials for user accounts.
- Gained initial shell access via SMB.

## Host Enumeration
- Gathered system information using `systeminfo` and PowerShell.
- Discovered local users and groups.
- Identified vulnerable services and misconfigurations.

## Network Enumeration
- Used `netstat` and `arp` to map local network.
- Scanned internal hosts with `nmap` through pivoting.
- Enumerated open shares and services on other hosts.

## Privilege Escalation
- Identified unquoted service paths.
- Exploited weak permissions on scheduled tasks.
- Used token impersonation and credential dumping.

## Lateral Movement
- Used SMB and RDP to move laterally.
- Used harvested credentials for access.
- Established persistence via scheduled tasks.

## Flag Capture
- Retrieved flags from user directories and sensitive files.

---

## Tools Used
- smbclient
- enum4linux
- nmap
- PowerShell
- Metasploit Framework

---

## Conclusion
This lab enhanced my understanding of internal network exploitation post-initial compromise, emphasizing enumeration, lateral movement, and privilege escalation techniques.
