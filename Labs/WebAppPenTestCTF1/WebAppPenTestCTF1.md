## Objective
Perform a full web application penetration test on the target machine, exploiting vulnerabilities to gain access and retrieve the flag.

---

## Step 1: Initial Reconnaissance

I began by scanning the target IP with nmap to identify open ports and running services:

\`\`\`bash
nmap -sC -sV -p- TARGET_IP
\`\`\`

The scan revealed port 80 running HTTP, which became my main focus.

---

## Step 2: Web Enumeration

I opened the target in a browser and explored the homepage. To discover hidden paths, I ran directory enumeration using gobuster:

\`\`\`bash
gobuster dir -u http://TARGET_IP -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
\`\`\`

This revealed an /admin path and a /login page.

---

## Step 3: Testing Login Page for SQL Injection

At the login page, I tested for SQL Injection by inputting '\' OR '1'='1' -- ' in the username and password fields. The application accepted this, indicating a likely SQLi vulnerability.

---

## Step 4: Exploiting SQL Injection for Authentication Bypass

Using the classic SQL injection payload:

\`\`\`sql
' OR 1=1-- -
\`\`\`

I was able to bypass login authentication and gain admin access.

---

## Step 5: Uploading a Reverse Shell via File Upload

Within the admin panel, I found a file upload functionality that only accepted .txt files. I prepared a PHP reverse shell script, renamed it to shell.php.txt, and successfully uploaded it.

---

## Step 6: Getting a Reverse Shell

I set up a listener on my machine:

\`\`\`bash
nc -lvnp 4444
\`\`\`

Then, I accessed the uploaded shell file in the browser:

\`\`\`
http://TARGET_IP/uploads/shell.php.txt
\`\`\`

This triggered a reverse shell, giving me command execution on the target.

---

## Step 7: Post-Exploitation and Flag Capture

I navigated to the web root and read the user flag:

\`\`\`bash
cat /var/www/html/user.txt
\`\`\`

After enumerating the system, I found a privilege escalation vector which I used to elevate my privileges to root. Finally, I captured the root flag.

---

## Summary

- Performed full port scan and web service enumeration.
- Discovered SQL Injection vulnerability on login page.
- Bypassed authentication using SQLi.
- Exploited file upload vulnerability for remote code execution.
- Gained reverse shell and captured both user and root flags.

---

## Commands and Tools Used

- nmap
- gobuster
- Manual SQL Injection testing
- nc for reverse shell listener
- Basic Linux commands for enumeration and flag retrieval

This lab reinforced my skills in web application testing, SQL Injection exploitation, and post-exploitation techniques.
