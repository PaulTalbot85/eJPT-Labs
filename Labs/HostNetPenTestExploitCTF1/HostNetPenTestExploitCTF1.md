# Host and Network Penetration Testing - Exploitation CTF 1 (eJPT / INE)

## Objective
Perform host and network exploitation to compromise systems and collect flags.

---

## Reconnaissance
- Ran `nmap` scan to identify live hosts and open ports.
- Detected SMB and other services on the target machines.
- Enumerated SMB shares and extracted useful information.

## Exploitation
- Exploited services like SMB and RDP.
- Used tools like Metasploit and `smbclient` to gain initial access.
- Delivered payloads to execute commands remotely.

## Privilege Escalation
- Identified weak service permissions and stored credentials.
- Used tools like `winPEAS` and manual enumeration.
- Escalated to SYSTEM or Administrator where possible.

## Lateral Movement
- Reused credentials and tokens across the internal network.
- Pivoted to other machines using `PsExec` and Impacket scripts.
- Maintained persistence with reverse shells.

## Flags Captured
- Successfully retrieved all flags as per the challenge objectives.

---

## Tools Used
- nmap
- Metasploit
- smbclient
- impacket (smbexec, psexec)
- PowerShell

---

## Conclusion
This lab demonstrated the full post-exploitation process, including access, escalation, and pivoting. It improved real-world pentesting readiness.
