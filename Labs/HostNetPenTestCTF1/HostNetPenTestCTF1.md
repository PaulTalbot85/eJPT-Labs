# Host and Network Penetration Testing - CTF 1 (eJPT / INE)

## Objective
This lab focuses on post-exploitation enumeration, lateral movement, privilege escalation, and flag capture within an internal host and network environment.

---

## Initial Access
- Used SMB enumeration tools like `enum4linux` and `smbclient`.
- Identified valid user credentials.
- Obtained initial shell access via SMB share exploitation.

## Host Enumeration
- Gathered system details using commands like `systeminfo` and PowerShell.
- Enumerated users, groups, and services.
- Discovered vulnerable configurations and installed software.

## Network Enumeration
- Mapped internal network with `netstat` and ARP.
- Scanned internal hosts using `nmap` through a pivot.
- Identified open shares and accessible services on other hosts.

## Privilege Escalation
- Located unquoted service paths and weak file permissions.
- Exploited scheduled tasks for privilege escalation.
- Dumped credentials and tokens for further access.

## Lateral Movement
- Leveraged SMB and RDP protocols to move laterally.
- Used harvested credentials to authenticate on other hosts.
- Established persistence via scheduled tasks and services.

## Flag Capture
- Extracted flags from user directories and sensitive files.

---

## Tools Used
- smbclient
- enum4linux
- nmap
- PowerShell
- Metasploit Framework

---

## Conclusion
This lab provided valuable experience in post-exploitation host and network enumeration, lateral movement techniques, and privilege escalation methods within an internal network.
