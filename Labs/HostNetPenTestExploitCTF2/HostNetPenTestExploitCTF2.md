# Host and Network Penetration Testing - Exploitation CTF 2 (eJPT / INE)

## Objective
This lab focuses on exploiting network hosts, gaining remote code execution, privilege escalation, and lateral movement to capture flags.

---

## Reconnaissance
- Scanned target hosts and services using nmap.
- Enumerated SMB shares and accessible resources.
- Collected user credentials via enumeration techniques.

## Exploitation
- Leveraged vulnerabilities in exposed services for initial access.
- Uploaded and executed payloads on the target.
- Used Metasploit and Impacket tools for exploitation.

## Privilege Escalation
- Discovered misconfigured permissions and vulnerable scheduled tasks.
- Used token impersonation and service exploitation to escalate privileges.

## Lateral Movement
- Moved through the internal network by using harvested credentials.
- Accessed additional hosts via SMB and RDP.
- Established persistence mechanisms.

## Flags Captured
- Retrieved user and system flags from compromised hosts.

---

## Tools Used
- nmap
- smbclient
- Metasploit Framework
- PowerShell
- Impacket

---

## Conclusion
This lab enhanced understanding of exploiting internal hosts, privilege escalation, lateral movement, and flag capture.
