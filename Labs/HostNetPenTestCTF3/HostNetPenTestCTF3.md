# Host and Network Penetration Testing - Exploitation CTF 3 (eJPT / INE)

## Objective
This lab involves exploiting vulnerabilities in internal hosts to gain code execution, escalate privileges, and move laterally within the network.

---

## Initial Reconnaissance
- Enumerated services with `nmap` and `smbclient`.
- Identified vulnerable SMB shares and accessible hosts.
- Collected credentials through various enumeration techniques.

## Exploitation
- Used known exploits against exposed services.
- Leveraged misconfigured SMB shares to upload and execute payloads.
- Achieved remote code execution on target hosts.

## Privilege Escalation
- Identified misconfigurations and vulnerable scheduled tasks.
- Exploited service permissions to escalate privileges.
- Extracted tokens and credentials to access higher-privileged accounts.

## Lateral Movement
- Pivoted through compromised hosts.
- Used harvested credentials with SMB and RDP for further access.
- Established persistence through scheduled tasks and services.

## Flag Retrieval
- Captured flags from user directories and sensitive system files.

---

## Tools Used
- nmap
- smbclient
- Metasploit Framework
- PowerShell
- Impacket tools

---

## Conclusion
This lab enhanced my skills in exploiting internal network hosts, performing post-exploitation enumeration, privilege escalation, and lateral movement to capture all flags.
